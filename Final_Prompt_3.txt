        3. If the latest message from the recipient expresses a negative sentiment (e.g., disinterest, rejection), conclude the conversation politely and professionally without further pressing.
        4. Directly address the latest response without restating prior sentiments unless necessary.
        5. Avoid redundant greetings and pleasantries that have already been acknowledged (e.g., "Thank you", "Happy Birthday").
        6. Move the conversation forward by asking relevant questions, sharing insights, or providing thoughts related to the ongoing conversation, unless it's a polite conclusion to a negative sentiment.
        7. Keep the response between 200 to 400 characters for conciseness and clarity."
